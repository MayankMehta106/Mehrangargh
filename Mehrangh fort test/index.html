                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Mehrangarh Fort, one of the largest forts in India, stands as a testament to the rich history and architectural brilliance of Rajasthan. Perched 400 feet (122 m) above the city of Jodhpur, this imposing structure is a magnificent example of Rajput architecture.</p>
                    
                    <p>The fort's name "Mehrangarh" derives from two words: "Mehr," meaning sun or Sun-deity (a reference to the clan's claimed descent from the Sun), and "garh," which means fort. Thus, Mehrangarh stands for "Fort of the Sun" ‚Äì a fitting name for a structure that dominates Jodhpur's skyline.</p>
                    
                    <p>Enclosed by imposing thick walls, Mehrangarh Fort houses several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards. The fort complex includes numerous buildings, including the Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), Sileh Khana, and Daulat Khana.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, Mehrangarh Fort is managed by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust and serves as a museum, cultural center, and popular tourist destination. It offers visitors a glimpse into the royal heritage of Jodhpur and the splendor of Rajasthan's past.</p>

                        <h3>Foundation by Rao Jodha</h3>
                        <p>Mehrangarh Fort was established by Rao Jodha, the 15th ruler of the Rathore clan, when he transferred his capital from Mandore to Jodhpur. According to legend, to build the fort, Rao Jodha had to displace a hermit called Cheeria Nathji, the lord of birds. Enraged at being forced to move, the hermit cursed Jodha that the fort would suffer from scarcity of water. To counter this curse, Rao Jodha built a temple within the fort and buried a man alive in the foundations (a practice called "nara-bali" or human sacrifice) to ensure the fort's good fortune.</p>

                        <p>The fort faced its first major military challenge when Mughal Emperor Humayun briefly captured Jodhpur. This event marked the beginning of a complex relationship between the Rathores and the Mughals that would shape the fort's development over the next centuries.</p>
